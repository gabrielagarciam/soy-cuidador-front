# 🧠 Personal Blog About Alzheimer’s

This is a personal blog built with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), where I share my experience as a **caregiver for my mother with Alzheimer’s**. It’s a space for reflection, support, and giving voice to what many people live in silence.
